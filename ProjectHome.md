The aim of the project is to add support for Lazarus/FPC and Linux to the Fortes report generator. This a port, not a fork, so there's no added features nor (hopefully) functional differences. The diffs will be kept minimal so to make easy to port the changes to new releases of the upstream project.

This port is not derived from the project fortes4lazarus, but build from scratch from the upstream sources. Anyway, some code has code has been copied verbatim from it and in general used as a reference.

The Fortes Report is developped by Fortes Inform√°tica Ltda.
